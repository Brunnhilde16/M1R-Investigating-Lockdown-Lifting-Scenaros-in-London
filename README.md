# M1R-Investigating-Lockdown-Lifting-Scenaros-in-London
This is the code for my M1R Poster Project. 

It includes code for:
1. The deterministic SEMHIRF Model
2. The Parameter Estimation
3. The Dashboard for simulating cyclic lockdown scenarios - special thanks to Amir for spotting and fixing the very last error!
4. The Stochastic Network Model
